    <p>This course provides a comprehensive foundation in design and code for the open web. There are two primary aspects to Introduction to Web Design—the first is learning how to build websites and prepare the visual and audio elements that comprise them; the second is understanding concepts behind computers in general and the web in particular.</p>

    <p>Topics include markup language, style language, web graphics, and browser-based interactivity. In addition to coding with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, we utilize open-source software to produce media optimized for the web browser. Web standards, accessibility, and open source are guiding principles of the course, which integrates creativity with the fundamentals of front-end web development.</p>
